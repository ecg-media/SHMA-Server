The app is part of the [SHMA](https://github.com/orgs/we-kode/projects/5) project. With this app one can stream audio from one audio input device to devices in local network. Streaming over the internet is not supported by this project and will not be maintained. To Listen to the streams the [SHMA-Client](https://github.com/we-kode/SHMA-Client) is required.
